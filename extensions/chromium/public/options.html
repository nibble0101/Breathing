          <p>
            <strong> Breathing</strong> is a simple application to help you
            relax. We all face unnerving situations sometimes. Perhaps you are
            preparing for an exam, interview, your first conference talk, or a
            life-changing activity which makes you nervous. We all experience
            that feeling. Sometimes just breathing in and out is what you need.
            It helps calm you down and soothe your nerves. And that is the
            purpose of this application. <strong>Breathing</strong> helps you
            relax by breathing in and out.

            The default breathing count is <strong>10</strong>. Breathing count
            is the number of times one breaths in and out in a breathing
            session. If you breath in and out once, that is one breathing count.
            Its value should be an integer between 10 and 100 inclusive.
